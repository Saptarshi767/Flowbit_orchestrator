- **Custom workflow engines**: With professional services assistance
- **Legacy systems**: Through data extraction and conversion

## Migration Strategies

### 1. Lift and Shift Migration
**Best for**: Simple workflows with minimal dependencies
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Approach**: Direct import with minimal modifications

**Process**:
1. Export workflows from source platform
2. Import into Robust AI Orchestrator
3. Test and validate functionality
4. Update configurations as needed
5. Switch traffic to new platform

### 2. Gradual Migration
**Best for**: Complex environments with many workflows
**Timeline**: 1-3 months
**Approach**: Migrate workflows in phases

**Process**:
1. Assess and prioritize workflows
2. Migrate non-critical workflows first
3. Run parallel systems during transition
4. Gradually migrate critical workflows
5. Decommission old platform

### 3. Hybrid Approach
**Best for**: Organizations with mixed requirements
**Timeline**: Ongoing
**Approach**: Keep some workflows on original platforms

**Process**:
1. Identify workflows that benefit from migration
2. Migrate suitable workflows
3. Maintain integration between platforms
4. Evaluate additional migrations over time

## Pre-Migration Assessment

### 1. Workflow Inventory
Create a comprehensive inventory of your existing workflows:

```bash
# Example inventory template
Workflow Name | Platform | Complexity | Dependencies | Priority | Migration Effort
Customer Onboarding | N8N | Medium | CRM, Email | High | 2 days
Data Processing | Airflow | High | Database, S3 | Medium | 1 week
Lead Scoring | Zapier | Low | Salesforce | High | 1 day
```

### 2. Dependency Analysis
Identify external dependencies:
- **APIs and Services**: Third-party integrations
- **Databases**: Data sources and destinations
- **Authentication**: SSO and credential systems
- **Monitoring**: Existing monitoring and alerting
- **Compliance**: Regulatory and security requirements

### 3. Resource Planning
Estimate migration resources:
- **Technical team**: Developers and system administrators
- **Timeline**: Migration schedule and milestones
- **Testing**: Quality assurance and validation
- **Training**: User education and adoption
- **Support**: Ongoing maintenance and support

        'url': 'https://n8n.company.com',
        'api_key': 'n8n-api-key'
    },
    date_range=('2023-01-01', '2024-01-01'),
    batch_size=100
)
```
