### 5. Collaborative Editing with Operational Transforms ✅

**Implementation:**
- Basic operational transform algorithm for concurrent editing
- Operation queuing and conflict resolution
- Support for different operation types (NODE_ADD, NODE_UPDATE, NODE_DELETE, etc.)
- Real-time operation broadcasting

**Operation Types:**
- `NODE_ADD` - Add new node to workflow
- `NODE_UPDATE` - Update existing node
- `NODE_DELETE` - Delete node from workflow
- `EDGE_ADD` - Add new edge/connection
- `EDGE_UPDATE` - Update existing edge
- `EDGE_DELETE` - Delete edge from workflow
- `WORKFLOW_UPDATE` - Update workflow metadata

**Transform Rules:**
- Concurrent node additions are offset to avoid overlap
- Update operations on deleted nodes are converted to add operations
- Basic conflict resolution for simultaneous edits

### 6. Integration Tests for Collaboration Features ✅

**Implementation:**
- Comprehensive unit tests for all collaboration services
- Route testing with mocked dependencies
- WebSocket event testing
- Error handling validation
- Permission and authorization testing

**Test Coverage:**
- `collaboration.unit.test.ts` - 15 unit tests covering core functionality
- `collaboration.routes.test.ts` - 18 integration tests covering API endpoints
- All tests passing with proper mocking and validation

## Technical Architecture

### WebSocket Integration
- Socket.IO server integrated with Express application
- CORS configuration for frontend integration
- Session management with automatic cleanup
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates

### Database Schema Extensions
The implementation assumes the following database tables exist:
- `WorkflowComment` - Comments and threaded discussions
- `WorkflowFork` - Fork relationships
- `MergeRequest` - Merge request tracking
- `TeamWorkspace` - Team workspace management
- `WorkspaceMember` - Workspace membership and roles

### Security and Permissions
- JWT-based authentication (mocked in tests)
- Role-based access control for all operations
- Ownership validation for sensitive operations
- Organization-scoped data isolation

### Real-time Features
- WebSocket connections for live collaboration
- Cursor and selection sharing
- Real-time comment notifications
- Operational transform for concurrent editing
- Session tracking and user presence

// Join workflow session
socket.emit('join-workflow', {
  workflowId: 'workflow-123',
  userId: 'user-123',
  userName: 'John Doe'
})

// Listen for other users joining
socket.on('user-joined', (data) => {
  console.log(`${data.data.userName} joined the workflow`)
})

// Send cursor updates
socket.emit('cursor-update', {
  workflowId: 'workflow-123',
  userId: 'user-123',
  cursor: { x: 100, y: 200 }
})
```

```javascript
// Create a comment
const response = await fetch('/api/workflows/workflow-123/comments', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer token',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    content: 'This workflow needs optimization',
    parentId: null // or parent comment ID for replies
  })
})
```

### Fork and Merge Workflow
```javascript
// Fork a workflow
const forkResponse = await fetch('/api/workflows/workflow-123/fork', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer token',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'My Fork of Original Workflow',
    description: 'Adding new features'
  })
})

// Create merge request
const mergeResponse = await fetch('/api/workflows/forked-workflow-456/merge-requests', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer token',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    targetWorkflowId: 'workflow-123',
    title: 'Add new optimization features',
    description: 'This merge request adds performance optimizations'
  })
})
```
